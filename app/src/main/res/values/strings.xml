    <string name="description">The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde is a philosophical novel that explores themes of vanity, morality, and the corrupting influence of hedonism. The story follows Dorian Gray, a handsome and youthful man who becomes infatuated with the idea of eternal beauty. Under the influence of the decadent Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian has a portrait painted of himself and wishes that it would age instead of him. As Dorian indulges in a life of excess and immoral behavior, the portrait grows increasingly distorted, reflecting the corruption of his soul, while Dorian himself remains young and untouched. The novel delves into the consequences of living a life of indulgence without regard for the effects on one\'s character and soul.</string>
